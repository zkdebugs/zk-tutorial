# ZK-Tutorial

This is a foundational resource for you to expand upon or use as is. Simply utilize the export function in your framework to start a brief tutorial. It will showcase the locations you've configured, along with a live cam stream of activities at those spots. If you encounter any issues, please open a GitHub issue with the repository steps, and I'll take care of it.

## Export

To initiate the toturial pop up simply use the following export in your script. 

```bash
  exports.zk-tutorial:InitiateTutorial()
```
